# ADA-120p-2022
Code for my APEX managing the 120p. Also anything useful that source control history that I find useful.

## Installation

This project requires `node v17+` to be installed as well as `yarn`. I recommend using `homebrew` to install `yarn` and use `nvm` to install node.

All the code is written in `Javascript`.


## Generating the APEX code

Simply run `yarn build`. This will generate APEX code inside of the `dist` folder. The current code is always checked into source control.
